# ðŸŽ‡Contributing Guidelines

---

First of all thanks for taking time out to contribute :smiley: :partying_face:

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.

## ðŸ’»Before Contributing

Welcome to [Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems](https://github.com/Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems). Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you **read the whole
guidelines**. If you have any doubt about the contributing guide, please feel free to reach out.

## ðŸ™ŒContribution

Your contributions can be adding a solution to a **new practice problem** of the **existing domain (SQL)** or you can come up with the solution of **any other domain (For example, C++, Java, Python, etc.)**. Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

### ðŸ”–Steps to Contribute

Following are the steps to guide you:

* Step 1: Star and Fork the repo Go to your Git terminal and clone it on your machine.
* Step 2: Add an upstream link to the main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems.git
    ```
* Step 3: Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main
    ```
* Step 4: Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it)
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
* Step 5: Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningful but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 6: Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
* Step 7: Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing)

11. It would be appreciated if you add approach and notes to your solution (especially for difficult problems)- [Example 1](https://github.com/Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems/blob/main/SQL/1.%20BASIC%20SELECT/10.%20Weather%20Observation%20Station%205.sql), [Example 2](https://github.com/Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems/blob/main/SQL/3.%20AGGREGATION/17.%20Weather%20Observation%20Station%2020.sql).
12. Create a pull request and also give your hackerrank submission link in the description so that it can be easily reviewed and merged.

<!--14. After your PR has been merged, please update [README.md](https://github.com/Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems/blob/main/README.md) as follows:
  - Find the appropriate position in Readme.md for adding your problem details. 
  - Syntax :
    ` | S.No. | [Problem Name](problem link) | [Solution](github link to the solution) | Score | Difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) |`
    <br> For example, <br> | 03. | [Select All](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/select-all-sql/problem) | [Solution](https://github.com/Riddhi9570/HackerrankPracticeProblems/blob/main/SQL/1.%20BASIC%20SELECT/03.%20Select%20All.sql) | 10 | Easy |
